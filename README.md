<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For one of our final projects at Prime Digital Academy we were given a 2-week sprint to build a full stack CRUD app from scratch. This was an opportunity to bring everything together and showcase what we've learned in the past 13 weeks. We spent the week prior to this brainstorming ideas, creating wireframes, and building out a scope document, before diving into development. 

We were given free reign to decide what the premise of our app would be, but were encouraged to choose something meaningful to us. With that in mind, I turned to my wife to ask if she had any problems that I could take on. My wife is an avid quilter, and I had seen her struggle in the past when starting a new project. She would purchase patterns online, but choosing which fabrics to use was not an easy process. Most of the fabrics she uses are not simple, solid colors, so you can imagine that it would be difficult to visualize what your quilt would end up looking like when using different fabrics. There are tools available online, but none that she could find that fit this specific need. This is where the idea for "Pass the Good Scissors!" was born.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Users can upload, comment on and delete images of their fabric
<img width="1034" alt="saved-fabrics" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b3d124f-2e98-49df-abf7-48d7ce565927" />

Users can then use those fabrics to fill the grid on the planning tool. The grid size can be changed, and they can also download their finished quilt pattern.
